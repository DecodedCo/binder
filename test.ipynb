    "## What are Association Rules?\n",
    "Association rules are an example of *unsupervised (rule-based) learning*. The rule `A -> B` quantifies the likelihood of co-occurence i.e. if event A occurs, what is the likelihood that event B also occurs? The \"events\" A and B could represent anything e.g. certain items being present in a shopping basket, an employee being sick, a stock going up, and so on. We are interested in whether one event often occurs with another or increases the likelihood of another occuring (but we are **not** talking about causation!).\n",
    "\n",
    "This form of analysis is used to discover relationships in large-scale transaction data recorded by point-of-sale (POS) systems in supermarkets. Data scientists were looking for items that were commonly bought together so that they could use this data to offer customers better deals. For example, the rule `{onions, potatoes} -> {burger}` found in the sales data of a supermarket would indicate that if a customer buys onions and potatoes together, they are likely to also buy burgers - a supermarket could use this data to intentionally stock certain items near to each other in the store, or supply particular discounts. \n",
    "\n",
    "Association Rules have since been used to find relationships between any sequences of things. Examples include things like web analytics (how someone behaves on a website), intrusion detection in cybersecurity (strange series of behaviours might indicate a hack) and bioinformatics in healthcare.\n",
    "\n",
    "These rules are most commonly built using the Apriori and ECLAT algorithms. We're going to be using Apriori for this notebook exercise, which you have learnt about in the online reading!"

E.g. If {eggs, milk} => {bread} has a confidence of 0.6 and the itemset {eggs, milk} has a support of 0.0001, then eggs and milk appear in 0.01% of all transactions, and 60% of the time that eggs and milk are bought, bread is bought as well."
